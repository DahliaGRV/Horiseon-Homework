Throughout this exercise I went through the Index.html and updated all of the div tags to reflect modern semantic. 
I changed the first div to be a header. The one directly within that tag I changed to article and updated the following tags that, as well. 
I went down the line, finding the correct semantic based on the elements within the tags and updated them.
All the while changing the CSS to reflect the changes.
After I had the HTML updated, I went through the CSS and consolidated it down, merging the repeaters. 
I did go through and test everything- after I had pushed it to GitHub and realized that one of my links didn't work due a tag missing for the first one.
